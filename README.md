##Synopsis

The Electronics Lab Project - Hand-Held Device for measuring distance and shape detection using Arduino UNO Board and Ultrasonic Sensor. For giving commands like 2D and 3D Measurement , me and my team used Peizoelectric Sensors in the form of Touch Sensors which were inserted in gloves.

##Code Example

The code represent the different stages through which we went during our progress in the Project. First we wrote an Arduino Code for LCD and Ultrasonic Sensor. Then for Ultrasonic Sensor and Peizoelectric Sensors. Afterwards, we integrated all these three components in our Project. Finally , the final source code with Touch Sensors giving commands such as 2D and 3D measurement while Ultrasonic Sensor measuring distance which gets into array due to Arduino code and gets displayed on the LCD.

##Motivation

1. In homes , our parents measure distance using measuring tape which can be cumbersome at times.
2. So we came up with this idea of glove tape where anybody can measure distance from 2cm to 3m. Also it can tell an approximate shape of any object.

##Tests

1. You need a Arduino IDE on your PC.
2. You will need an Arduino UNO Board, LCD, Breadboard, Touch Sensors, Ultrasonic Sensor, Gloves and Connecting Wires.
3. Just connect the LCD, Ultrasonic Sensor and Peizoelectric Sensors (depending on how many commands you want to give) to the Arduino UNO Board according to the references given.
4. Please connect accordingly to the pin numbers we have used as parameters in our functions of LCD and Ultrasonic and Peizoelectric Sensors in the code.
5. Connect them all onto gloves and your project is ready.
